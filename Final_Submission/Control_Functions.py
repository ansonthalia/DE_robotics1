#-------------------Control Functions---------------------
'''This file is a selection of functions called by House_of_Cards() to add some robustness to the process of
building the structure.These functions allow the system to know if issues have arisen during the brick moving
process. The system can know if it Drops a Brick, the Structural Fails and ........Enter what Sophies Code does here........'''
